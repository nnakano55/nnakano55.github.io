                                    This is a data visualization project that I made with two other teammates.
                                    The project focuses on the suicide problem of Japan and visualize the data
                                    in a map and a graph in order to find correlations. The user will use the double
                                    slider to determine the years that the visualization will use for its data.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    We used <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> to create the visualizations.
                                    We used the D3 library to create a geomap of Japan and a bar graph. The Map 
                                    of Japan is divided by prefecture(47 in total) and each prefecture is colored 
                                    in by the average data of the years determined by the double slider. The Graphic 
                                    is also colored, but more importantly divided up by the reason why the person committed
                                    suicide.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    I was the project lead for this project. I was in charge of dividing up the work with
                                    my teammates, collecting the data, and making sure that the code they wrote works with 
                                    other parts of the project. <br/><br/>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Looking back at the project, there are definitely things I could of done better. Like 
                                    for example I formatted the page using a giant table. If I were to go back and redesign the 
                                    page I would definitely do that and make sure the page works with smaller window sizes. There are
                                    other things I would change, but overall I am proud of this project and I am glad that my teammates and
                                    I decided to go with it.<br/><br/>

                            Brand Recognizer is a team project I worked on for one of my course works: Mobile Apps.
                            The app's main focus is to take a photo of a brand and bring up information 
                            about the particular brand. We utilized the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" target="_blank">Google Vision AI</a> to figure out 
                            brand of the photo that is taken.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            My personal contribution to the project is the login system. I used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> 
                            to create the system. There is the regular SignIn/SignUp system, which I did make a very simple system 
                            where it just takes a email and password and remembers it. I regret not making a security system to 
                            check if the email is valid or check if the email is actually the user, for that would have been a good experience
                            for me to create a system that has a good security system. I also included a login system using the user's
                            Google account, Facebook account, and Twitter account. These were relatively easy because there was already
                            a library to connect these account information to firebase, and each of these services have provided a button
                            for developers to use in their apps.

                                Everybody's Sad is VR game made as a final project for the CMPM 160 series.
                                The game was made on <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> 
                                using Unity's VR source code. The game takes place in a room where there are certain 
                                objects in the area which need help of some sorts. The player's objective is to satisfy
                                these objects eventually leave the room by progressing the story.  
                            </p>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                My personal contribution to the project was general programming, but more importantly I was in charge
                                of doing the graphics programming. My job was to create shaders for particular characters 
                                in the game and also applying full screen effects on the camera. Some of the effects I created include
                                a cell shading I made to apply on important characters in the game, and a fullscreen effect that adds
                                a greyscale effect to the screen when the player reaches a certain point in the game.
